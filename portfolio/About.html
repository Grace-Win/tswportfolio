		<h1>More about me!</h1>
		<p>Originally from the vibrant city of Yangon, Myanmar, I'm a multi-faceted individual with a passion for creativity and exploration.<b>In my free time, I find joy in a variety of activities. </b>Whether it's diving into the virtual worlds of gaming, expressing myself through dance, singing along to my favorite tunes, sketching imaginative scenes, or simply getting lost in the melodies of music, I cherish every moment of self-expression and discovery.

			<b>My interests in music and space fuel my curiosity and wonder.</b>I find inspiration in the melodies of groups like Seventeen and Enhypen, and the mysteries of the cosmos never fail to captivate my imagination.<b>One of my greatest sources of happiness is my beloved pet, Holy.</b>His companionship brings warmth and joy to my life every day.<b>When it comes to food, Ramyeon holds a special place in my heart.</b>There's something comforting about a steaming bowl of noodles, especially during late-night adventures. <b>As a dedicated night owl, I embrace the quiet hours of the evening to indulge in my love for reading and movie-watching.</b>Whether I'm immersed in a captivating book or transported to another world through a compelling film, I cherish the escape and inspiration they provide.<b>And as for my ultimate dream destination, New Zealand beckons with its breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural tapestry.</b>Someday, I hope to explore its wonders and create unforgettable memories.</p>
